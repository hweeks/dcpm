# Manifest

## Overview

The manifests here are based heavily off of `npm`'s packages. I'm originally a js dev, so if any of this looks like some excessive love for that style of code, empathize with me please.

A manifest for a deployed package looks like this:

```yml
about:
  name: "My fancy config"
  author: "hweeks <root@hweeks.com>"
  about: "./README.md"
  version: "1.0.0"
  tags:
    - "something"
    - "something else"
remotes:
  scm: "https://github.com/me/my-fancy-config"
  blobs: "https://blobs.dcpm.dev"
config: "./docker-compose.yml"
overrides:
  dev: "./docker-compose.dev.yml"
  stable: "./docker-compose.stable.yml"
scripts:
  configure: "./some-bash-file.sh"
supports:
  docker: "19.03.1"
  docker-compose: "1.24.1"
env:
  - name: SOME_VAR
    message: What is your favorite color?
    default: red
```

### about

The about object defines your project in human readable terms. If you have a `readme.md` in the root we will display it as the about page of your config through [blob search](https://search.dcpm.dev)

#### name

The name of your config. It must be unique to be published.

#### author

The maintainer of your config.

#### version

A semver compliant version of your package.

#### tags

These are hints for people looking up packages about what to expect from yours or what it does. It also makes the in-built search suck less.

#### about

This is the markdown flavored info about your package. At some point there will be a front end to view available packages.

### remotes

This is a listing of the places that your code lives.

#### scm

This is the url to whatever place you store your source code.

#### blobs

Optional: This is the place to upload your config to when publishing.

### config

This is just the location of your compose file.

### overrides

Optional: This is a listing of all your different environment overrides.

### scripts

Optional: This is a listing of helper scripts you've built. It runs in the CWD of the package executing it. Currently logs output, no nice error catching or anything of merit.

### supports

Optional: This is a mapping of what versions you support of docker and docker-compose.

#### docker

The version of docker you support. Ranges are fine.

#### docker-compose

The version of docker-compose you support. Ranges are fine.

### env

Optional: This is an array of objects of this shape:

```
var: The variable name
msg: The question to prompt you user with
fallback: The default value
```

Fallback is optional, the user will be asked these questions and a .env will be built automatically. This can be used to make setup nice and easy for an end user.

## Defining Files to Keep and Ignore

By default we zip up everything in your configs, about, overrides, and manifest. You can also add a `.dcpmkeep` and a `.dcpmignore` file. These accept standard glob patterns, with the ignore always overriding the keep if specified. If you want to include any 'dot files', make sure to do so explicitly in your `.dcpmkeep` file.
